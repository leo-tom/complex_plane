SCPL(Simple Complex Processing Library) is library to evaluate simple expression with complex numbers in Rust.
It also has features to express complex plane which can be saved as image file.
To compile it, do

git clone git@github.com:leo-tom/complex_plane.git
cd complex_plane
cargo build --release

or add
scpl = { git = "https://github.com/leo-tom/complex_plane" , branch = "master"}
at [dependencies] section of your Cargo.toml.

HowTo.html can help you to learn how to use this library. Correct me if there is weird Engulishu inside of it...
